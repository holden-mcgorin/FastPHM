###  
> This framework is specifically designed for deep learning experiments in the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), such as **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction**, **Fault Diagnosis** and **Anomaly Detection**. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and lightweight experimental platform that helps users quickly build PHM workflows, greatly simplifying code development and enhancing both research and engineering efficiency.  
> The project is continuously evolving, and more reproducible research cases based on this framework will be added over time. You're welcome to ⭐ star the project and join the discussion!


## 🚀     Feature Overview

- 🔧 **Modular and Extensible Design**: Add custom algorithms or components with minimal effort

## 💻    Experiment Example

The following is a **minimal working example** for completing a PHM experiment (RUL prediction), containing only the **basic steps** of data loading, model training, and evaluation — perfect for quick start.

> This example focuses on the minimum runnable workflow. The framework supports much more powerful features, which are demonstrated in the `Notebook Examples` under the project root directory.

Just a few lines of code are enough to complete an end-to-end experiment workflow:

```python
# Step 1: Initialize the data loader and labeler
data_loader = CMAPSSLoader('D:\\data\\dataset\\CMAPSSData')
labeler = TurbofanRulLabeler(window_size=30, max_rul=130)

# Step 2.1: Load and label the training dataset
turbofans_train = data_loader.batch_load('FD001_train', columns_to_drop=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 13, 19, 21, 22])
train_set = Dataset()
for turbofan in turbofans_train:
    train_set.add(labeler(turbofan))

# Step 2.2: Load and label the test dataset
turbofans_test = data_loader.batch_load('FD001_test', columns_to_drop=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 13, 19, 21, 22])
test_set = Dataset()
for turbofan in turbofans_test:
    test_set.add(labeler(turbofan))

# Step 3: Initialize the model and trainer, then begin training
model = MyLSTM()
trainer = BaseTrainer()
trainer.train(model, train_set)

# Step 4: Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset
tester = BaseTester()
result = tester.test(model, test_set)

# Step 5: Configure evaluation metrics and compute performance scores
evaluator = Evaluator()
evaluator.add(MAE(), MSE(), RMSE(), PercentError(), PHM2012Score(), PHM2008Score())
evaluator(test_set, result)
```

After integrating the visualization code and additional functional components, the program produced the following output in the CMD environment.  
( This example demonstrates how the program runs in a command-line interface.
For local development, however, it is recommended to use integrated development environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook for a more efficient and user-friendly experience. )

## 📚 Reproduced Papers
> This framework has been used to reproduce several published methods in the PHM field.  
> The original contributions are treated with full respect. If the reproduced results deviate from the originals, it may be due to differences in implementation or experimental setup, or potentially due to oversights during reproduction. Feedback and suggestions are warmly welcomed via the issue section.

## ⚠     Important Notes
> - This framework is developed using Python 3.8.10. Compatibility issues may arise with other versions. If you encounter any problems, feel free to raise an issue.
> - When reading datasets, do not change the internal file structure of the original datasets (you may keep only partial data). Altering the file structure may lead to data reading failures.
